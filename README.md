# lastfm-curretly-playing-obs

this is a package that gets the currently playing list from last.fm and displays it in the browser

it is built to be put into OBS as a browser source

set the width to the width of the window (the program changes the width depending on the title
set the height to 300px

to get it to work, add a `constants.js` file in the root of the project (next to the HTML file) and fill it like such

```js
window.config = {
	user: '**YOUR LAST.FM USERNAME**',
	api_key: '**LAST.FM API KEY**',
};
```

## note

this does mess with the global `window` object in order to set the config in a seperate file (i dont want my api key on here), this isnt going to be a problem but any ts-lint software may become angry, `fix.d.ts` should fix this

```
